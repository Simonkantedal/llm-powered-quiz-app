# What is this?
This is a quiz application that allows the user to create a custom quiz and deploy it to a web server. The repository implements both a frontend, backend and simple database. The user can create custom questions with free text answers.

## What is the USP?
The unique selling point of this application is that the point giving is automated using AI. This means that an LLM is used to evaluate the answers given by the user and assign points based on the correctness of the answer. This allows for a more flexible and dynamic quiz experience, as the LLM can understand a wide range of answers and provide feedback accordingly.
